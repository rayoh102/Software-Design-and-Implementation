# Same as twoNodeGraph.test, but reverse the order of node adding to test if it prints out in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph twoNodesGraphAlphabetical

# Add two nodes in reverse alphabetical order
added node b to twoNodesGraphAlphabetical
added node a to twoNodesGraphAlphabetical

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a and the outgoing edges from b
twoNodesGraphAlphabetical contains: a b
the children of a in twoNodesGraphAlphabetical are:
the children of b in twoNodesGraphAlphabetical are:
