# Tests adding two nodes, one edge on the same node and one edge between two nodes to graph

# Create a graph
created graph twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween

# Add two nodes
added node a to twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween
added node b to twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween

# Add two edges
added edge AA from a to a in twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween
added edge AB from a to b in twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a and the outgoing edges from b
twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween contains: a b
the children of a in twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween are: a(AA) b(AB)
the children of b in twoNodesTwoEdgesOneSameOneBetween are:
