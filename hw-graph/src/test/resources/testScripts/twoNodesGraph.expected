# Tests adding two nodes to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph twoNodesGraph

# Add two nodes
added node a to twoNodesGraph
added node b to twoNodesGraph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a and the outgoing edges from b
the children of a in twoNodesGraph are:
the children of b in twoNodesGraph are:
