# Test adding two nodes, with two edges between the two nodes and two edges on the same nodes

# Create a graph
created graph twoNodesFourEdgesGraph


# Add two nodes
added node a to twoNodesFourEdgesGraph
added node b to twoNodesFourEdgesGraph


# Add four edges
added edge AA from a to a in twoNodesFourEdgesGraph
added edge AB from a to b in twoNodesFourEdgesGraph
added edge BA from b to a in twoNodesFourEdgesGraph
added edge BB from b to b in twoNodesFourEdgesGraph


# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a and the outgoing edges from b
the children of a in twoNodesFourEdgesGraph are: a(AA) b(AB)
the children of b in twoNodesFourEdgesGraph are: a(BA) b(BB)
