# Tests if we can create multiple instances of the same graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Create another graph
created graph graph2

# Add a node to first graph
added node n1 to graph1

# Add same node to second graph
added node n1 to graph2

# Repeat for another node
added node n2 to graph1
added node n2 to graph2

# Add edges for both graphs
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph2

# Test children in both graphs
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n1 in graph2 are: n2(e1)
