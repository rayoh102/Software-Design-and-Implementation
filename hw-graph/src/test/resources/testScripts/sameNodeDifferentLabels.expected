# Tests if we can connect between the same node with different labels

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Add same edge, different label
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Check edges
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)
