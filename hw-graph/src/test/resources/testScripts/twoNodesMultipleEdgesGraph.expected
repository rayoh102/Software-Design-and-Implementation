# Tests adding two nodes, multiple edges to graph.

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_multiple_edges_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph
added node b to twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph

# Add five edges
added edge AA from a to a in twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph
added edge AB1 from a to b in twtwoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph
added edge AB2 from a to b in twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph
added edge BA from b to a in twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph
added edge BB from b to b in twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph


# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a and the outgoing edges from b
twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph contains: a b
the children of a in twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph are: a(AA) b(AB1) b(AB2)
the children of b in twoNodesMultipleEdgesGraph are: a(BA) b(BB)
