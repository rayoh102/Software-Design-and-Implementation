# Tests adding one node with edge to itself to graph

# Create a graph
created graph oneNodeSameEdgeGraph


# Add a node
added node a to oneNodeSameEdgeGraph


# Add an edge
added edge AA from a to a in oneNodeSameEdgeGraph


# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from a
oneNodeSameEdgeGraph contains: a
the children of a in oneNodeSameEdgeGraph are: a(AA)
