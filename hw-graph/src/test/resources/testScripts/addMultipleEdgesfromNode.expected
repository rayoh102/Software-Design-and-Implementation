# Tests multiple edge addition from one node

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add another node
added node n2 to graph1

# Add another node
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Add another edge
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1

# See if edge was added properly
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
