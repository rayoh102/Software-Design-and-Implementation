# Test adding multiple nodes and types of edges on a graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e1 from n2 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Make sure nodes exist
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Check connections
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1) n2(e2)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e2) n2(e1)
