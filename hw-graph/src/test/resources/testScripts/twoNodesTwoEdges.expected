# Tests adding two nodes, two edges between the two nodes to graph.

# Create a graph
created graph twoNodesTwoEdges

# Add two nodes
added node a to twoNodesTwoEdges
added node b to twoNodesTwoEdges

# Add two edges
added edge AB from a to b in twoNodesTwoEdges
added edge BA from b to a in twoNodesTwoEdges

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a and the outgoing edges from b
twoNodesTwoEdges contains: a b
the children of a in twoNodesTwoEdges are: b(AB)
the children of b in twoNodesTwoEdges are: a(BA)
