# Tests double reflexive edge addition with a single node

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add reflexive edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Add another reflexive edge
added edge e2 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# See if edges are reflexive
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1) n1(e2)
