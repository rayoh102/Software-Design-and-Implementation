# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm where we
# need to use rounding.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 12.214 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.313 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 3.513 from B to D in simpleGraph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 10.000
B to D with weight 3.513
total cost: 13.514
