created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 599.323 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 12.214 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.313 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 3.513 from B to D in simpleGraph

the children of A in simpleGraph are: B(10.000) C(12.214) C(599.323)
