Application does not compile.

## Code quality and implementation

### Design: 2/3

### Code quality: 3/3

#### Code Review Feedback

You should split Map.tsx into separate modules based on functionality,
right now it does too much. Also avoid using external libraries unless needed;
using bootstrap incorrectly for your menu causes the application not to compile.
